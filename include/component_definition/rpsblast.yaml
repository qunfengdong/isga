Name: RPSBLAST
Description: 'Reverse psi-blast, or rpsblast, is a program that searches a query protein sequence or protein sequences against a database of position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs, profiles, or more commonly known as conserved domains) to identify the ones the query is simlar to. This is the opposite of what PSI-BLAST and its standalone counterpart blastpgp does, which generates PSSMs for the query and uses that to score query to database alignment, hence the Reverse. rpsblast uses a BLAST-like algorithm, finding single- or double-word hits and then performing an ungapped extension on these candidate matches. If a sufficiently high-scoring ungapped alignment is produced, a gapped extension is performed and those gapped alignments with sufficiently low expect value are reported as result. The PSSMS used to query against are provided by Priam (http://priam.prabi.fr/).  The output of this component includes RPSBLAST raw results in both full format and btab format.'
Params:
  - { NAME: 'expectvalue', TITLE: 'Expect Value', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '1e-5', ERROR: ['Number::isScientificNotation'], DESCRIPTION: 'Statistical significance threshold for reporting database sequence matches. Lower expected thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported. Increasing the expected threshold shows less stringent matches.', CONFIGLINE: '___EXPECT___' }
  - { templ: 'select', NAME: 'filter', TITLE: 'Filter', REQUIRED: 1, OPTION: ['True', 'False'], OPT_VAL: ['T', 'F'], VALUE: 'T', ERROR: [], DESCRIPTION: 'Filter query sequence with SEG', CONFIGLINE: '___FILTER___' }
  - { NAME: 'nummatches', TITLE: 'Number of Matches', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '150', ERROR: ['digitonly'], DESCRIPTION: 'The number of database sequences to show alignments for in the output.', CONFIGLINE: '___DATABASE_MATCHES___' }
  - { NAME: 'numdescirptions', TITLE: 'Number of Descriptions', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '150', ERROR: ['digitonly'], DESCRIPTION: 'The number of database sequences to show one-line descriptions for in the output.', CONFIGLINE: '___DESCRIPTIONS___' }

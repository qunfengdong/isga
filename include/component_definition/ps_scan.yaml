Name: 'Prosite Scan'
Description: 'A program used to scan one or several patterns, rules and/or profiles from PROSITE against one or several protein sequnces in Swiss-Prot or FASTA format.'
Params:
  - { templ: 'select', NAME: 'profile_cutoff_level', TITLE: 'Profile Cutt-Off Level', OPTION: [0, -1], VALUE: 0, DESCRIPTION: 'Most profiles contain several cut-off levels. The level 0 cut-off is the trusted cut-off for positive matches, but a level -1 is usually defined above which a match is potential, especially if there are other matches in the sequence with the profile. By default, pfscan is run with the cut-off level 0, so that only trusted matches are reported. To retrieve potential (weak) matches as well, run ps_scan with the option "-1". Weak matches are then reported with the indication "L=-1".', FLAG: '-l', CONFIGLINE: '___opts___' }
  - { templ: 'check', NAME: 'skipfrequent', TITLE: 'Skip Frequently Matching Patterns', OPTION: 'Skip Frequently Matching Patterns', OPT_VAL: '-s', DESCRIPTION: 'Some PROSITE entries such as those describing commonly found post-translational modifications (a typical example is N-glycosylation) are found in the majority of known protein sequences. While it is generally useful to note their presence, some programs may want, in some cases, to ignore those entries.  This is off by default.', CONFIGLINE: '___opts___' }
  - { templ: 'check', NAME: 'greediness', TITLE: 'Turn Off Greediness', OPTION: 'Turn Off Greediness', OPT_VAL: '-g', DESCRIPTION: 'A pattern-matching engine is said to be "greedy" if it tries to extend at most variable-length pattern elements. The sequence "ABCDC" and the pattern "A-x(1,3)-C" will produce the match "ABCDC" with a greedy engine, and the match "ABC" with a non-greedy one. By default, PROSITE is scanned in greedy mode.',  CONFIGLINE: '___opts___' }
  - { templ: 'check', NAME: 'overlaps', TITLE: 'Turn Overlaps Off', OPTION: 'Turn Overlaps Off', OPT_VAL: '-v', DESCRIPTION: '  Some patterns may produce distinct but overlapping matches on a given sequence.  Additionally, if the pattern contains variable-length elements, some of these matches may be completely included in another one. Different combinations of Greediness, Overlaps and Include options may produce differences in match count and match positions with patterns that contain variable-length elements. An engine which allows overlaps should be greedy in order to reduce the number of multiple hits which are almost entirely overlapping except at the extremities.', CONFIGLINE: '___opts___' }
  - { templ: 'check', NAME: 'include', TITLE: 'Allow Included Matches', OPTION: 'Allow Included Matches', OPT_VAL: '-i', DESCRIPTION: '  Some patterns may produce distinct but overlapping matches on a given sequence.  Additionally, if the pattern contains variable-length elements, some of these matches may be completely included in another one. Different combinations of Greediness, Overlaps and Include options may produce differences in match count and match positions with patterns that contain variable-length elements. An engine which allows overlaps should be greedy in order to reduce the number of multiple hits which are almost entirely overlapping except at the extremities.', CONFIGLINE: '___opts___' }

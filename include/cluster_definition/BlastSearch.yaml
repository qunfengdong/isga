Cluster: BLAST Search
Description: 'The BLAST search cluster performs a BLAST homology search using a set of translated sequences as input against a non-redundant database comprised of several sources including NCBI, SwissProt, PDB, etc.  The BLAST result is then used as input for the BER algorithm.  A modified Smith-Waterman alignment (Smith and Waterman, 1981) is performed on the protein against the mini-database of BLAST hits. In order to identify potential frameshifts or point mutations in the sequence, the gene is extended 300 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the predicted coding region. If significant homology to a match protein exists and extends into a different frame from that predicted, or extends through a stop codon, the program will continue the alignment past the boundaries of the predicted coding region.  The output of this cluster includes BLAST raw results in both full format and btab format and also BER raw results in btab format.'

      - { templ: 'select', NAME: 'scoringmatrix', TITLE: 'Scoring Matrix', REQUIRED: 1, OPTION: ['PAM30', 'PAM70', 'BLOSUM45', 'BLOSUM62', 'BLOSUM80'], VALUE: 'BLOSUM62', DESCRIPTION: 'Use the specified scoring matrix (default BLOSUM62)', CONFIGLINE: '___MATRIX___' }
      - { NAME: 'evalue', TITLE: 'e-value', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '1e-5', ERROR: [], DESCRIPTION: 'Statistical significance threshold for reporting database sequence matches. Lower expected thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported. Increasing the expected threshold shows less stringent matches.', CONFIGLINE: '___EXPECT___' }
      - { NAME: 'blastfilter', TITLE: 'BLAST Filter', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: 'none', ERROR: [], DESCRIPTION: 'Filtering can eliminate statistically significant but biologically uninteresting reports from the BLAST output by masking out various segments of the query sequence for regions which are non-specific for sequence similarity searches. This leaves the more biologically interesting regions of the query sequence available for specific matching against database sequences. For example, it may be desired to mask acidic, basic or proline-rich segments of a protein that would otherwise yield overwhelming amounts of uninteresting, non-specific matches against a wide array of protein families. The SEG program (Wootton and Federhen, 1993) masks low compositional complexity regions, while XNU (Claverie and States, 1993) masks regions containing short-periodicity internal repeats. SEG+XNU will combine the above two. The DUST program by Tatusov and Lipman can only be used with DNA searches (BLASTn) and will mask simple repeats in DNA/RNA sequences.  (e.g., "seg", "xnu", "ccp", "dust" or "none")', CONFIGLINE: '___FILTER___' }

Cluster: HMM Search
Description: 'The HMM search cluster uses hmmpfam to perform similarity searches against an HMM database to identify protein family or domain matches.  Hmmpfam reads a sequence file and compares each sequence in it, one at a time, against all the HMMs in the HMM databse looking for significantly similar sequence matches.  Hmmpfam is run against a dataset which includes both PFAM and TIGRFAM HMM information.  The output of this cluster is the hmmpfam raw result.'

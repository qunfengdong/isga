<p>Welcome to the pipeline building walkthrough.  To the right, you will 
notice a toolbox.  Throughout the customization process, this area will 
contain diffent sections that allow you to create your pipeline and 
review details about your pipelines current configuration.</p>

<p>To begin customizing a pipeline, please click 
<span class="highlight">Pipelines</span> on the drop down menu.  
If this is your first time customizing a pipeline, the section 
will currently contain only the Prokaryote Annotation Pipeline.  
However, as you customize pipelines, this section will become 
populated with your customized pipelines.  Also, any pipelines 
you are currently customizing and have not finalized will be 
present in the Continue Customizing section on the same page.</p>

   8 => 'Also score orfs that extend off the end of the sequence(s). This option presumes that the sequence(s) is linear and not circular. Reported positions off the end of the sequence are the nearest positions in the correct reading frame. Note that this ignores any partial codons at the ends of a sequence. Suppose, for example, that a sequence is 998bp long and an orf in reading frame +1 starts at position 601 and extends off the end of the sequence. Then the end of that gene/orf will be reported at position 999, as if the stop codon were in positions 997. . . 999. This is true even if the last two characters of the sequence are, say, cc and cannot possibly be part of a stop codon.  

Any scores associated with orfs that extend past the end of a sequence are computed using only complete codons contained in the sequence.

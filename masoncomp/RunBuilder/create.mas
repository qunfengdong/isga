<h1>Submission Builder</h1>

<p>This tool allows you to describe and assign input files to a
pipeline in order to execute a submission.</p>

<p>Your progress will be saved, and you can return to building your
run at any time by clicking on 'Resume Pipline Submission' under 'Monitor Pipelines' in the navigation bar.</p>

<p>You must choose a name to distinguish this submission. You may also 
provide an optional description.</p>

<p>This page allows you to name your submission and also create any notes 
about your submission that may help you distinguish it in the future.  
A Run name is differnt than a pipeline name.  Your submission will be 
associated with the pipeline you chose to run and the pipeline 
will be listed accordingly when browsing your submissions.  A descriptive 
name will be helpful in the future when reviewing results.  Please 
create a name and any notes and click Continue to proceed.  The 
name and notes can be updated anytime throughout the Submission building 
process.</p>

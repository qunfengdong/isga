  Help: 'For the raw output, tmhmm gives some statistics and a list of the location of the predicted transmembrane helices and the predicted location of the intervening loop regions.  If the whole sequence is labeled as inside or outside, the prediction  is that it contains no membrane helices.  It is probably not wise to interpret it as a prediction of location. The prediction gives the most probable location and orientation of transmembrane helices in the sequence. It is found by an algorithm called N-best (or 1-best in this case) that sums over all paths through the model with the same location and direction of the helices.<br>The first few lines gives some statistics:<br><br>  * Length: the length of the protein sequence.<br>  * Number of predicted TMHs: The number of predicted transmembrane helices.<br>  * Exp number of AAs in TMHs: The expected number of amino acids intransmembrane helices. If this number is larger than 18 it is very likely to be a transmembrane protein (OR have a signal peptide).<br>  * Exp number, first 60 AAs: The expected number of amino acids in transmembrane helices in the first 60 amino acids of the protein. If this number more than a few, you should be warned that a predicted transmembrane helix in the N-term could be a signal peptide.<br>  * Total prob of N-in: The total probability that the N-term is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.<br>  * POSSIBLE N-term signal sequence: a warning that is produced when "Exp number, first 60 AAs" is larger than 10.'

  Help: 'This program first does a BLAST search (Altschul, et al., 1990) (http://blast.wustl.edu) of each protein against niaa and stores all significant matches in a mini-database. Then a modified Smith-Waterman alignment (Smith and Waterman, 1981) is performed on the protein against the mini-database of BLAST hits. In order to identify potential frameshifts or point mutations in the sequence, the gene is extended 300 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the predicted coding region. If significant homology to a match protein exists and extends into a different frame from that predicted, or extends through a stop codon, the program will continue the alignment past the boundaries of the predicted coding region. The results can be viewed both as pairwise and as multiple alignments of the top scoring matches.  The raw results are presented in btab (BLAST tabulated format).'

  Help: 'The organisms genes are listed sorted by their end coordinate and terminators are output between them.

"Conf" (which ranges from 0 to 100) is what you probably want to use to assess the quality of a terminator. Higher is better. The confidence, hp score, and tail scores are described in the paper cited above.  "Loc" gives type of region the terminator is in:<br><br>    "G" = in the interior of a gene (at least 50bp from an end),<br>    "F" = between two +strand genes,<br>    "R" = between two -strand genes,<br>    "T" = between the ends of a +strand gene and a -strand gene,<br>    "H" = between the starts of a +strand gene and a -strand gene,<br>    "N" = none of the above (for the start and end of the DNA)<br><br>Because of how overlapping genes are handled, these designations are not exclusive. "G", "F", or "R" can also be given in lowercase, indicating that the terminator is on the opposite strand as the region.  Unless the all-context option is given, only candidate terminators that appear to be in an appropriate genome context (e.g. T, F, R) are output.

  Help: "The graphical output from SignalP (neural network) comprises three different scores, C, S and Y. Two additional scores are reported in the SignalP3-NN output, namely the S-mean and the D-score, but these are only reported as numerical values. For each organism class in SignalP; Eukaryote, Gram-negative and Gram-positive, two different neural networks are used, one for predicting the actual signal peptide and one for predicting the position of the signal peptidase I (SPase I) cleavage site. The S-score for the signal peptide prediction is reported for every single amino acid position in the submitted sequence, with high scores indicating that the corresponding amino acid is part of a signal peptide, and low scores indicating that the amino acid is part of a mature protein. The C-score is the ``cleavage site' score. For each position in the submitted sequence, a C-score is reported, which should only be significantly high at the cleavage site. Confusion is often seen with the position numbering of the cleavage site. When a cleavage site position is referred to by a single number, the number indicates the first residue in the mature protein, meaning that a reported cleavage site between amino acid 26-27 corresponds to that the mature protein starts at (and include) position 27. Y-max is a derivative of the C-score combined with the S-score resulting in a better cleavage site prediction than the raw C-score alone. This is due to the fact that multiple high-peaking C-scores can be found in one sequence, where only one is the true cleavage site. The cleavage site is assigned from the Y-score where the slope of the S-score is steep and a significant C-score is found. The S-mean is the average of the S-score, ranging from the N-terminal amino acid to the amino acid assigned with the highest Y-max score, thus the S-mean score is calculated for the length of the predicted signal peptide. The S-mean score was in SignalP version 2.0 used as the criteria for discrimination of secretory and non-secretory proteins. The D-score is introduced in SignalP version 3.0 and is a simple average of the S-mean and Y-max score. The score shows superior discrimination performance of secretory and non-secretory proteins to that of the S-mean score which was used in SignalP version 1 and 2. For non-secretory proteins all the scores represented in the SignalP3-NN output should ideally be very low. The hidden Markov model calculates the probability of whether the submitted sequence contains a signal peptide or not. The eukaryotic HMM model also reports the probability of a signal anchor, previously named uncleaved signal peptides. Furthermore, the cleavage site is assigned by a probability score together with scores for the n-region, h-region, and c-region of the signal peptide, if such one is found."

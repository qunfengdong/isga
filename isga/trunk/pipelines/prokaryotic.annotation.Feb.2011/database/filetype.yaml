- Help: 'This is the KEGG color map images produced by Asgard.     The input for color map is up to five .paths files generated by ASGARD. By default, the data from the sample files will appear in blue, red, yellow, and green, and from the reference one in black. Most map entities (usually enzymes) are present as a rectangle in the KEGG maps - color map will add a line to each side of the rectangle, starting on the top line and going clockwise from there, for each sample where the entity is detected as present (the same sample is always on the same side). If it was detected in the reference sample, a large dot will be placed on the top left corner of the rectangle.'

- Help: 'This filetype is the raw results produced by using the BER algorithm on the raw results of a previously performed BLAST search.  A modified Smith-Waterman alignment (Smith and Waterman, 1981) is performed on the protein against the mini-database of BLAST hits. In order to identify potential frameshifts or point mutations in the sequence, the gene is extended 300 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the predicted coding region. If significant homology to a match protein exists and extends into a different frame from that predicted, or extends through a stop codon, the program will continue the alignment past the boundaries of the predicted coding region. The results can be viewed both as pairwise and as multiple alignments of the top scoring matches.  The raw results are presented in btab (BLAST tabulated format).'

- Help: 'ORF prediction results produced by gene prediction algorithms such as Glimmer3.  The raw data is ORF coordinate, reading frame, strand, and score information used to extract a nucleotide sequence from a sequence data file.  However, the extracted genes in FASTA format are included in this file type as well.  When supplying as input, this can simply be a set of genes in FASTA format.  When retrieving as output from a pipeline you are receiving the raw coordinate data.  We also provide the extracted ORFs in FASTA format as another file type'

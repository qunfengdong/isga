<p>ISGA relies on many underlying bioinformatics programs to perform analysis, and running pipelines on typical large data sets, requires a distributed computing environment, such as Sun Grid Engine, to perform analyses in a timely manner. Detailed installation instructions as well as a list of prerequisite software are available at the <a target="blank" href="https://wiki.cgb.indiana.edu/display/brp/isga-install">ISGA wiki</a>.</p>

<p>To run ISGA you will need the MasonX::Foundation perl library also developed at the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics.</p>

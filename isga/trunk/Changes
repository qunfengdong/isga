Revision history for ISGA

1.5.1   Dec 1 2011
	
	BUG FIXES

	* Fixed bug in specifying a run for update_run_status.pl
        * Print 'Disabled' for value of disabled checkboxes when annotating custom parameters in
          PipelineBuilder.
	* Resolved corner case where run with some output already generated could not be canceled.

	WEB CHANGES

	* Modified file collection views to handle archived file collections
	* Add Transcriptome database query and view pages
	* Added link to reset all parameters for a component when building a custom pipeline
	
	API CHANGES
	
	* When creating a PipelineBuilder with a UserPipeline template, current customizations are now kept 
	  separate from any customizations to the template until the pipeline is finalized. This allows us
	  to 'reset' changes in the PipelineBuilder while still maintaining the starting state. 
	* Added Archived feature for file collections, where a .tgz file is stored rather than individual files
	* Config files are now generated through Mason rather than regexps, allowing each replacement to be done 
	  through a method call.
	* Replace calls to legacy rmtree with remove_tree	
	* Tweaked RunningScript class to be a generic queueing system for farming tasks out to the command line
	* Add classes for storing transcriptome annotation results
	* Migrated work of preparing RunBuilder parameter form from FormEngine to RunBuilder class so 
	  it can be subclassed.
	* Replaced monolithic Run->updateStatus transaction with separate transactions for each RunOutput to save
	  previous work when an update fails or is aborted.

	DETAILED API CHANGES

        * Removed getConfigFile() and getConfigFileName() methods from ISGA::Component - replaced by 
	  getConfigFilePath()
	* Removed getDecoratedInputValue() method from ISGA::Component - replaced by getInput()
	* Added getIteration() and getParameter() methods to ISGA::Component.	
	* Added getComponent() and injectMaskValues() methods to ISGA::ParameterMask.

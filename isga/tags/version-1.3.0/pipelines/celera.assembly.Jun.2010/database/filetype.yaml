 - Name: 'Native 454 format'
   Help: 'The proposed SFF file format is a container file for storing one or many 454 reads. 454 reads differ from standard sequencing reads in that the 454 data does not provide individual base measurements from which basecalls can be derived. Instead, it provides measurements that estimate the length of the next homopolymer stretch in the sequence (i.e., in "AAATGG", "AAA" is a 3-mer stretch of As, "T" is a 1-mer stretch of Ts and "GG" is a 2-mer stretch of Gs). A basecalled sequence is then derived by converting each estimate into a homopolymer stretch of that length and concatenating the homopolymers.'
 - Name: 'Celera Assembler native format'
   Help: 'These FRG files consist of sequencer reads and relationships between the reads. Two types of relationships are defined: libraries and mates. A library indicates that all reads in this collection come from the same insert library and thus share numerous properties: end orientation, clone size, randomness, approximate read size, etc. A mate indicates that exactly two reads are from opposite ends of a single clone in a library.'
 - Name: 'Celera Assembler Output'
   Help: 'An output produced by the celera assembler program.'

 - Name: 'Hawkeye Input'
   Help: 'Hawkeye reads the assembly data from an AMOS bank. A bank is a special directory of binary encoded files containing all information on an assembly. A bank is created by the AMOS assemblers directly, or by converting the results of others assemblers into AMOS format.'
 - Name: 'Genome Sequence'
   Help: 'The whole sequence of a genome, contig, plasmid, chromosome, etc'

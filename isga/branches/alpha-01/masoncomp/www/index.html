<h1>SysMicro Pipeline Service</h1>

<p>Welcome to the SysMicro Pipeline Service <strong>Test</strong>. We appreciate your help in developing this utility. Please report all bugs and suggestions to <a href="mailto:biohelp@cgb.indiana.edu">biohelp@cgb.indiana.edu</a></p>

<p>The current release only contains our express pipeline, which runs
glimmer3 for orf prediction, then runs HMMPFAM and BLAST against to
predict gene function.</p>

<h2>Release Schedule:</h2>

<p>We will be releasing a new test version each Tuesday morning. We
will try to preserve accounts and data across versions, but some fixes
may have incompatibilities that require a database wipe. If you
generate important results, please be sure to save them before Monday
evening.  Also, jobs running on Tuesday mornings may be killed by the
release process.</p>

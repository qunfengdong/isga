<h1>Systems Microbiology Pipeline Service</h1>

<p>Welcome to the SysMicro Pipeline Service <strong>Test</strong>. We appreciate your help in developing this utility. Please report all bugs and suggestions to <a href="mailto:biohelp@cgb.indiana.edu">biohelp@cgb.indiana.edu</a></p>

<p>The Tools section to the right is used throughout the site.  It 
provides the interface for running, building, and customizing pipelines.  
The tools will change depending on the section you are currently working
in.</p>

<p>To begin using the service, please use the Request an Account option 
now and follow the directions as necessary.  If you already have an account, 
please use the login link in the upper right of the web page to log into 
the service.</p>

<p>The current release only contains our express pipeline, which runs
glimmer3 for orf prediction, then runs HMMPFAM and BLAST to predict
gene function.</p>

<h2>Release Schedule:</h2>

<p>We will be releasing a new test version each Tuesday morning. We
will try to preserve accounts and data across versions, but some fixes
may have incompatibilities that require a database wipe. If you
generate important results, please be sure to save them before Monday
evening.  Also, jobs running on Tuesday mornings may be killed by the
release process.</p>

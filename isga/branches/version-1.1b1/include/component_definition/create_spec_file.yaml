Params:
  - { NAME: 'ovlErrorRate', TITLE: 'Error Limit on Overlaps', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '0.06', ERROR: [ 'Number::isNumber' ], DESCRIPTION: 'Error limit on overlaps, for both Overlap Based Trimming and normal overlaps. The overlapper modules will not report overlaps over this limit. Default value is 0.6.', CONFIGLINE: '___ovlErrorRate___'}
  - { NAME: 'utgErrorRate', TITLE: 'Error Rate above Which Unitigger Discards Overlaps', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '0.015', ERROR: [ 'Number::isNumber' ], DESCRIPTION: 'The error rate above which unitigger discards overlaps.  Default value is 0.015.', CONFIGLINE: '___utgErrorRate___' }
  - { NAME: 'cnsErrorRate', TITLE: 'Error Rate for Consensus', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '0.06', ERROR: [ 'Number::isNumber', ['Number::isGreaterOrEqualFormValue', 'cnsErrorRate', 'ovlErrorRate', 'Error Limit on Overlaps'] ], DESCRIPTION: 'Error rate for consensus. Consensus will expect to find alignments below this level, but it does not strictly enforce it.   Default is 0.06', CONFIGLINE: '___cnsErrorRate___' }
  - { NAME: 'cgwErrorRate', TITLE: 'Error Rate for Scaffolder', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '0.10', ERROR: [ 'Number::isNumber' ], DESCRIPTION: 'Error rate for scaffolder. Scaffolder will try to merge unitigs and contigs up to this error rate.  Default value is 0.10.', CONFIGLINE: '___cgwErrorRate___' }
  - { NAME: 'merSize', TITLE: 'merSize', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '22', ERROR: [ 'digitonly' ], DESCRIPTION: 'Sets K, the length of each K-mer. This sets the length of the seeds used by the seed & extend algorithm. This parameter is equivalent to word size in BLAST. This parameter affects the ovl overlapper, the mer overlapper and the meryl seed finder. This parameter does not affect the umd overlapper. Setting this one parameter is eqivlalent to setting two others: obtMerSize and ovlMerSize. The result of setting all three is undefined. Default value is 22.', CONFIGLINE: '___merSize___' }

<h1>Systems Microbiology Pipeline Service</h1>

<p>Welcome to the SysMicro Pipeline Service <strong>Test</strong>. We appreciate your help in developing this utility. Please report all bugs and suggestions to <a href="mailto:biohelp@cgb.indiana.edu">biohelp@cgb.indiana.edu</a></p>

<p>The Tools section to the right is used throughout the site.  It 
provides the interface for running, building, and customizing pipelines.  
The tools will change depending on the section you are currently working
in.</p>

<p>To begin using the service, please use the Request an Account option 
now and follow the directions as necessary.  If you already have an account, 
please use the login link in the upper right of the web page to log into 
the service.</p>

<p>The current release only contains our express pipeline, which runs
glimmer3 for orf prediction, then runs HMMPFAM and BLAST to predict
gene function.</p>

<h2>Release Schedule:</h2>

<p>We will be releasing a new test version each Tuesday morning. We
will try to preserve accounts and data across versions, but some fixes
may have incompatibilities that require a database wipe. If you
generate important results, please be sure to save them before Monday
evening.  Also, jobs running on Tuesday mornings may be killed by the
release process.</p>

<p>Welcome to the pipeline building walkthrough.  To the right, you will 
notice a toolbox.  Throughout the customization process, this area will 
contain diffent sections that allow you to create your pipeline and 
review details about your pipelines current configuration.</p>

<p>To begin building and customizing a pipeline, please navigate to 
<span class="highlight">Pipelines</span> and choose <span class="highlight">
Public Pipelines</span> from the drop-down menu.  You may 
notice the My Pipelines section.  If this is your first time customizing 
a pipeline, the section will not currently contain any pipelines.  However, 
as you customize pipelines, this section will become populated.</p>

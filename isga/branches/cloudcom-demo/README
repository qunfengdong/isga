ISGA is  a service  created for the  purpose of providing  an enhanced
user   interface  to   the  genome   annotation  process   powered  by
Ergatis< http://ergatis.sourceforge.net/ >.  We  provide biology
users the following functions:

 - users can select which bioinformatics programs you want for your
   annotation process.
   
 - users have complete control over the parameters being used for each
   selected program.
	       
 - users have the ability to track individual analysis runs, i.e., you are
   able to see updated progress of where your analysis is and what is 
   currently being performed.
		        
 - users can do everything simply with a standard web browser without the
   need to install or maintain complex software.

This package allows bioinformaticians to install ISGA at their local
servers for better performance and flexibility. Please refer to the
INSTALL file for installation. For demo, please visit

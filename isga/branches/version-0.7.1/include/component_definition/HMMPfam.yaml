Name: HMMPfam
Description: 'Hmmpfam reads a sequence file and compares each sequence in it, one at a time, against all the HMMs in the HMM databse looking for significantly similar sequence matches.  Hmmpfam is run against a dataset which includes both PFAM and TIGRFAM HMM information.  The output is the hmmpfam raw result.'
Params:
  - { NAME: 'alignmentoutput', TITLE: 'Number of Alignment Output', ERROR: ['digitonly', 'Number::isPositive'], DESCRIPTION: 'Limits the alignment output to the n best scoring domains. 0 shuts off the alignment output and can be used to reduce the size of output files.  Leave blank to accept default behaviour', CONFIGLINE: '___OPT___', FLAG: '-A' }
  - { NAME: 'evaluecutoff', TITLE: 'e-value Cutoff', VALUE: '10.0', ERROR: ['Number::isNumber', 'Number::isPositive'], DESCRIPTION: 'Set the E-value cutoff for the per-sequence ranked hit list to x, where x is a positive real number. The default is 10.0. Hits with E-values better than (less than) this threshold will be shown.', CONFIGLINE: '___OPT___', FLAG: '-E' }
  - { NAME: 'bitscorecutoff', TITLE: 'Bit Score Cutoff', ERROR: ['Number::isNumber'], DESCRIPTION: 'Set the bit score cutoff for the per-sequence ranked hit list to x, where x is a real number. The default is negative infinity; by default, the threshold is controlled by E-value and not by bit score. Hits with bit scores better than (greater than) this threshold will be shown.',  CONFIGLINE: '___OPT___', FLAG: '-T' }
  - { NAME: 'evaluedatabase', TITLE: 'Number of Sequences in Database to Calculate e-value', ERROR: ['digitonly', 'Number::isPositive'], DESCRIPTION: 'Calculate the E-value scores as if we had seen a sequence database of n sequences. The default is arbitrarily set to 59021, the size of Swissprot 34.', CONFIGLINE: '___OPT___', FLAG: '-Z' }
  - { templ: 'check', NAME: 'forward', TITLE: 'Use Forward algorithim', OPTION: 'Forward algorithm', DESCRIPTION: 'Use the Forward algorithm instead of the Viterbi algorithm to determine the per-sequence scores. Per-domain scores are still determined by the Viterbi algorithm. Some have argued that Forward is a more sensitive algorithm for detecting remote sequence homologues.', CONFIGLINE: '___OPT___', OPT_VAL: '--forward' }
  - { templ: 'check', NAME: 'null2', TITLE: 'Turn off post hoc second null model', OPTION: 'Turn off null2', DESCRIPTION: 'Turn off the post hoc second null model. By default, each alignment is rescored by a postprocessing step that takes into account possible biased composition in either the HMM or the target sequence. This is almost essential in database searches, especially with local alignment models. There is a very small chance that this postprocessing might remove real matches, and in these cases --null2 may improve sensitivity at the expense of reducing specificity by letting biased composition hits through.', CONFIGLINE: '___OPT___', OPT_VAL: '--null2' }

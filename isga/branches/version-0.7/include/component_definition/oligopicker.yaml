Name: Oligopicker
Description: 'OligoPicker is for selecting up to five oligo probes for each of the DNA sequences you provided for microarray spotting.'
Params:
  - { templ: 'select', NAME: 'probecopy', TITLE: 'Probe Copy', REQUIRED: 1, OPTION: ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'], VALUE: '1', DESCRIPTION: 'This specifies how many non-overlapping unique probes are designed for each sequence.', CONFIGLINE: '___probecopy___' }
  - { NAME: 'probelength', TITLE: 'Probe Length', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '70', ERROR: [ 'digitonly', ['Number::isBetween', 20, 100], 'Number::isNumber' ], DESCRIPTION: 'This specifies the length for each of the probes in the probe set. The range is 20 - 100 bases and the recommended value is 70.', CONFIGLINE: '___probelength___' }
  - { NAME: 'tmrange', TITLE: 'Tm range', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '10', ERROR: [ ['Number::isBetween', 1, 30], 'Number::isNumber' ], DESCRIPTION: 'The allowable Tm range is 1 - 30C and the default value is set at 10C.  The screening stringency increases as the Tm range becomes smaller.', CONFIGLINE: '___tm___' }
  - { NAME: 'crossreactivity', TITLE: 'Cross-reactivity', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: '15', ERROR: [ 'digitonly', ['Number::isBetween', 10, 20], 'Number::isNumber' ], DESCRIPTION: 'This sets the threshold for rejection of contiguous matches. The range is 10 - 20 with the default value set at 15.  None of the designed unique oligo probes has any repetitive n-mer in any other input sequence. We believe that stretches of perfectly matched sequences (such as 15-mers) are more likely to cause cross-hybridization than longer homologous sequences with a few mismatches. The default value 15 is preferred because the probability of having two identical 15-mers is one out of10e9. This level of stringency should be enough for most sample universe. The smaller the number, the more stringent (the better) condition it is for microarray experiment. However, it is also increasingly difficult to select unique oligos for DNA sequences because of the more stringent selection criteria. As a result, OligoPicker may fail to pick unique oligos for some sequences.', CONFIGLINE: '___reactivity___' }
  - { NAME: 'threshold', TITLE: 'BLAST Threshold', REQUIRED: 1, VALUE: 30, ERROR: [ ['Number::isBetween', 20, 50], 'Number::isNumber' ], DESCRIPTION: 'This is supplemental to the n-mer contiguous match screening process. Oligos with NCBI BLAST score higher than the specified value will be discarded.', CONFIGLINE: '___threshold___' }
  - { templ: 'select', NAME: 'end', TITLE: 'End Preference', REQUIRED: 1, OPTION: ['5', '3'], VALUE: '5', DESCRIPTION: 'Probes can be selected from either the 5` or 3` end. OligoPicker will start to screen oligos from the end you selected. If the oligos do not qualify, OligoPicker will continue to screen oligos either upstream or downstream from the end until qualified oligos are found.', CONFIGLINE: '___end___' }
